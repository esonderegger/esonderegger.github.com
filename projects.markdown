Projects
========

Here are some things that I'm working on or have worked on:

Code

### [Modal Photo Gallery for Bootstrap/Jekyll](https://gist.github.com/2334002)
I put this together because I was frustrated with the state of image galleries available for
Twitter Bootstrap. [Click here to see a demo.](http://esonderegger.github.com/photography.html)

Working with the Jekyll posts system added a little bit of complexity. I
decided to make each photo its own post and create a python script that auto-generates the html files
that live in the _posts directory.

Music

### [Off Bass Brass: Knock Yourself Out](http://www.amazon.com/Knock-Yourself-Out-Bass-Brass/dp/B003H29SGU)
Off Bass Brass is a tuba/euphonium quartet consisting of Ryan McGeorge and  Mark Jenkins on euphonium
and John Cradler and Tom Holtz on Tuba. They Recorded "Knock Yourself Out" at the Landon School for Boys in early 2009
with me as their engineer. The CD was released on the [Potenza Music](http://www.potenzamusic.com/) label later that year.
